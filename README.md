## About

A revamped, responsive version of my vanilla HTML/CSS/JS site.

## Technology

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with 'create-next-app', utilizing the Tailwind CSS framework and deployed by Vercel. 

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Mulish and Lora, custom Google Fonts.
